# legoTrain
A project to experiment with LEGO train automation.

After a little bit of [research](https://www.bartneck.de/2024/12/31/introduction-to-lego-train-automation/) I decided to give [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com) a try since it allows me to use original LEGO parts to control the trains and the switches. I set myself the goal to control two trains on a simple track with one switch. A [video}(https://youtu.be/BIv__JPrNug) demonstrating the system is available on YouTube.

I created a flowchart to better communicate the different states and communications between the trains and the switch:
